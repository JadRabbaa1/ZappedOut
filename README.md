Project Description:
Zapped Out is a “stressometer” that sends a notification to a companion of your stress level. Through squeezing a stress ball implemented into a side pocket of a backpack, the user gets immediate stress relief, while also sending a signal that illuminates a range of thunderbolts on a piece of art that can be either hung or placed on a desk.

Code:
Since the two devices operate differently, this repository includes two folders for two codes. The first one "SendToPubnub" is for the first feather board connected to the flex sensor that acts as a (OUTPUT) or sender to Pubnub while as the second "ReadingFromPubNub" is for the second feather board that receives the information from pubnub act as INPUT and controls the 3 LED lights connected to it.
